                        Going into my first work term at NCR I had already set some goals for myself that I hoped to complete before the 8 months were over. I would quickly get the chance to start working towards them as not long after I first arrived I was put onto a sub-team formed from members of multiple other teams to help with the companies main regression period. During this regression period I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with many different team members to actively help find and fix issues across many different versions of Passport, one of the applications that NCR offers. Not only was I able to make meaningful contributions to help during the 2 week testing period, it also allowed me to further develop my understanding of long-term product maintenance and proper testing in a team environment. This directly fed into one of my learning goals of being able to improve my ability to work as a team member in an Agile development. While I wasn’t doing any development yet, I got the opportunity to experience the “real world” of testing and deadlines where I had where the progress I made was not only tracked but could affect others where I could help take on additional tests or have to have others help me complete mine. The contrast between what I was used to in an academic environment was very apparent which further contributed to both my exploration of the field and to help c xcontinue to apply the concepts that I had studied but never truly had a chance to actually utilize properly.

                        After the regression period ended and the sub-team disbanded, I began to work with my original team again helping to do some testing of new features. This heavily allowed me to explore a codebase that was much larger and older than anything I had worked on before. I had made a goal to try and improve my ability to improve my comprehension of code from other people and I certainly had the chance to challenge myself as I continued to test and learn about the system.</p>

                        One of the first customer requests I was able to work on was to look into adapting the existing system to harness a different form of encryption. This was a major stepping stone to help me learn how to understand an unfamiliar system. From researching how the encryption should work on the system to understanding how we needed to encrypt it, this story really helped me get used to the programs that I would be working with the rest of my co-op. I may not have done a lot of actual development but the skills I was able to enhance from this proved to be invaluable.

                        While I continued to explore how concepts I used on a smaller scale in assignments translated into a much larger one, I got an invitation to join a team for the companies annual Hackathon. I joined a full-time developer and three project managers on a team to create a new system that would be implemented internally in the Waterloo branch. The problem we tackled was an inefficient process for a vital part of the company and the solution we came up with was a streamlined automated system. The original process took the time of many different employees, resulted in the duplication of information over and over again in multiple different forms and was unable to make sure everyone was consistently updated with new information due to both the duplication of data and the fact that data would sometimes be lost before it could even be used. There was also a disjoint between the development teams and others who also needed this information and as a result problems could arise where one group would have information that the other would need without realizing the differing information. We were given the opportunity to design, develop and maintain an automated solution to help streamline the process and reduce the workload on many different employees at the company. This allowed for valuable time and money to be saved as the efforts of each employee was able to go towards more important tasks. The new solution utilized a centralized database to store all information, informed the correct stakeholders with automatic emails based on new additions or updates and enabled information to be updated and added in a much simpler fashion. The new solution also eliminated the need for one of the previous employees to be a part of the process allowing them to perform their actual job rather than having to oversee the old process to make sure things actually ran smoothly. We ultimately came second in the Waterloo branch losing by 1 vote, but the real achievements were soon to come.

                        After the Hackathon I took over the final development and maintenance of the new system, continuing to refine it and make sure everything would run smoothly. This was the best way for me to fully complete another one of my learning goals, to learn about how long term project maintenance and development works. From bug fixes to getting lots of positive and sometimes negative feedback about the new system, I now have a much deeper understanding of how to properly work with a project for a longer period of time. While 5 months is still relatively short compared to more maintenance periods, it has currently been the longest period of time that I have worked on a project that is used, let alone in a production environment. The process was a welcome change for many people though I had some ideas of how to improve it.

                        Before I could work towards that idea though, I was also given my first independent development story to further progress another one of my goals. I was assigned for the development of a new feature which allowed me to experience development in an Agile team. The feature I was developing was to modify user input as it was being typed to format it correctly. While the feature seemed small it helped to reinforce how important testing all possible edge cases was. With the feature having many small rules and even conflicting shortcuts the user was supposed to be able to use the supposedly simple story was a great challenge for me to tackle, ultimately finishing it just in time for the release.

                        In between all of this I had been approached to create a new internal system, one that would automate a security process, after 1 month and approaching 2 developers for help we concluded that one of the internal company process’ would have to be altered if we were to actually proceed with the idea. While the idea was scrapped due to the fact that an application was provided to automate it for us, I had the chance to learn and research about automating HTTP calls and running searches through a Windows File system.

                        In the last few weeks of my co-op I began to flesh out my idea to create a complete UI overhaul of the system. I took all the feedback I had received and implemented it into the UI. When I revealed it in a surprise debut it received some very positive feedback. I then started work on perfecting it to smooth out the last few issues and make sure it was tested thoroughly. In the last week of my co-op I worked with the original developer from the Hackathon again to continue work on the redesigned UI to help not only complete it but complete the handoff so that he could maintain it once I left. Being able to work on that project really let me explore many different aspects of being a developer and I believe it has let me achieve the goals I set at the beginning of those 8 months.
