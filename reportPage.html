                        Going into my first work term at NCR I had already set some goals for myself that I hoped to complete before the 8 months were over. I would quickly get the chance to start working towards them as not long after I first arrived I was put onto a sub-team formed from members of multiple other teams to help with the companies main regression period. During this regression period I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with many different team members to actively help find and fix issues across many different versions of Passport, one of the applications that NCR offers. Not only was I able to make meaningful contributions to help during the 2 week testing period, it also allowed me to further develop my understanding of long-term product maintenance and proper testing in a team environment. This directly fed into one of my learning goals of being able to improve my ability to work as a team member in an Agile development. While I wasn’t doing any development yet, I got the opportunity to experience the “real world” of testing and deadlines where I had where the progress I made was not only tracked but could affect others where I could help take on additional tests or have to have others help me complete mine. The contrast between what I was used to in an academic environment was very apparent which further contributed to both my exploration of the field and to help c xcontinue to apply the concepts that I had studied but never truly had a chance to actually utilize properly.

                    <p>
                        After the regression period ended and the sub-team disbanded, I began to work with my original team again helping to do some testing of new features. This heavily allowed me to explore a codebase that was much larger and older than anything I had worked on before. I had made a goal to try and improve my ability to improve my comprehension of code from other people and I certainly had the chance to challenge myself as I continued to test and learn about the system.</p>

                        One of the first customer requests I was able to work on was to look into adapting the existing system to harness a different form of encryption. This was a major stepping stone to help me learn how to understand an unfamiliar system. From researching how the encryption should work on the system to understanding how we needed to encrypt it, this story really helped me get used to the programs that I would be working with the rest of my co-op. I may not have done a lot of actual development but the skills I was able to enhance from this proved to be invaluable.

                        While I continued to explore how concepts I used on a smaller scale in assignments translated into a much larger one, I got an invitation to join a team for the companies annual Hackathon. I joined a full-time developer and three project managers on a team to create a new system that would be implemented internally in the Waterloo branch. The problem we tackled was an inefficient process for a vital part of the company and the solution we came up with was a streamlined automated system. The original process took the time of many different employees, resulted in the duplication of information over and over again in multiple different forms and was unable to make sure everyone was consistently updated with new information due to both the duplication of data and the fact that data would sometimes be lost before it could even be used. There was also a disjoint between the development teams and others who also needed this information and as a result problems could arise where one group would have information that the other would need without realizing the differing information. We were given the opportunity to design, develop and maintain an automated solution to help streamline the process and reduce the workload on many different employees at the company. This allowed for valuable time and money to be saved as the efforts of each employee was able to go towards more important tasks. The new solution utilized a centralized database to store all information, informed the correct stakeholders with automatic emails based on new additions or updates and enabled information to be updated and added in a much simpler fashion. The new solution also eliminated the need for one of the previous employees to be a part of the process allowing them to perform their actual job rather than having to oversee the old process to make sure things actually ran smoothly. We ultimately came second in the Waterloo branch losing by 1 vote, but the real achievements were soon to come.

                    <p>
                        After the Hackathon I took over the final development and maintenance of the new system, continuing to refine it and make sure everything would run smoothly. This was the best way for me to fully complete another one of my learning goals, to learn about how long term project maintenance and development works. From bug fixes to getting lots of positive and sometimes negative feedback about the new system, I now have a much deeper understanding of how to properly work with a project for a longer period of time. While 5 months is still relatively short compared to more maintenance periods, it has currently been the longest period of time that I have worked on a project that is used, let alone in a production environment. The process was a welcome change for many people though I had some ideas of how to improve it.

                    <p>
                        Before I could work towards that idea though, I was also given my first independent development story to further progress another one of my goals. I was assigned for the development of a new feature which allowed me to experience development in an Agile team. The feature I was developing was to modify user input as it was being typed to format it correctly. While the feature seemed small it helped to reinforce how important testing all possible edge cases was. With the feature having many small rules and even conflicting shortcuts the user was supposed to be able to use the supposedly simple story was a great challenge for me to tackle, ultimately finishing it just in time for the release.

                    <p>
                        In between all of this I had been approached to create a new internal system, one that would automate a security process, after 1 month and approaching 2 developers for help we concluded that one of the internal company process’ would have to be altered if we were to actually proceed with the idea. While the idea was scrapped due to the fact that an application was provided to automate it for us, I had the chance to learn and research about automating HTTP calls and running searches through a Windows File system.

                        In the last few weeks of my co-op I began to flesh out my idea to create a complete UI overhaul of the system. I took all the feedback I had received and implemented it into the UI. When I revealed it in a surprise debut it received some very positive feedback. I then started work on perfecting it to smooth out the last few issues and make sure it was tested thoroughly. In the last week of my co-op I worked with the original developer from the Hackathon again to continue work on the redesigned UI to help not only complete it but complete the handoff so that he could maintain it once I left. Being able to work on that project really let me explore many different aspects of being a developer and I believe it has let me achieve the goals I set at the beginning of those 8 months.

                        Working at JOMAR gave me the opportunity to tackle a more independent developer role, and work on improving my ability to be succinct. After going through the first few days of training I quickly had to adapt to the different working environment. Compared to my past experiences the company had implemented measures to keep each employee safe during the pandemic. One of these changes was that the full time staff was working an alternating schedule so the building was only ever at half capacity on any given day. This meant that I faced additional challenges but it also provided me with the opportunity to push myself further with some of my learning goals.

                        My first project was for the Burlington Hydroelectric company the main task for me was to create a way to export customer data and to do so I created a reusable JSON export class. One of the first challenges that I encountered was due to the rotating staff issue. In my previous coop I was usually able to talk to my mentors as I went through the project to ask any questions and verify the project goals. However because the full time staff also had to make up time for the days they were not in the office, my time with them was more limited. This helped me work towards my 2nd learning goal which was to improve my ability to communicate with a team over long distances given my past habits of overloading my messages with excess information. By the end of this project I had not only completed the project objectives but had also managed to slightly increase my confidence when messaging my mentor.

                    <p>
                        The second project I was assigned to was also for Burlington Hydro, this time I needed to create a new screen for them in the JOMAR application and add some new features for those screens. While I didn’t do as much software development for this project I got to learn about their queryXML system for the application and learn more about how it was incorporated into the program. I also ended up reusing the JSON exporter from the previous project.

                        After that project I began work with Waterloo North Hydro. This time my focus would be on the database side of things. I did have some previous experience with ORACLE SQL but this had a much larger scope than I was used too as we were migrating the entire database to a new version. The biggest challenge for me on this project was that due to the scale the changes that were to be made and all been documented in a very large Work Order. This meant that I had to go through and read and fully understand all the changes that needed to be made without having as many opportunities for face to face meetings. While I had to read through some sections multiple times I was able to understand what needed to be done and begin migrating the database over.  During this project I also got the opportunity to develop on the ORACLE SQL Triggers and Procedures as we migrated and changed them on a case by case basis. This project was halted halfway through as more decisions need to be made about specific changes with the customer so I was put on another project in the meantime.

                    <p>
                        While waiting on the approval to continue working on the previous project I worked on 2 more projects for Burlington Hydro the first was another simple change to some existing features to incorporate more data that they needed. The second was to add another screen and display the data from a different database refactoring that another co-op was doing.

                    <p>
                        After completing the previous two projects I was given the go-ahead to resume work on the Waterloo North Hydro project. I worked to finish up transferring the remaining Procedures and Triggers and went through both database tests and application tests to make sure the changes were all correct. While this part was fairly straightforward the whole project had allowed me to expand my knowledge and understanding of databases to better work with them in the future.

                        Near the end of that project I was also assigned a project for Glen Raven, this project also had me working on new screens and features but the system for this company was different so I had to quickly adapt and relearn the new systems differences compared to what I had grown used too. Here I was able to further hone my ability to understand how to fully make use of classes and methods when lacking the full source code. Through the examples I was provided and by reading through the bits of code I was working on I was able to fully understand the classes and methods I was using in order to efficiently and effectively implement my changes. As the changes were fairly straight forward, I was able to complete them without any other issues.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>
                        As the other aforementioned co-op continued on the database refactoring, I hopped back to Burlington Hydro to make some changes to how specific JSON files would be read in as the data contained within them had been changed. While the fix was fairly straight forward it gave me more opportunities to practices working on code where I only had a small subset of functions to work off of. With so many internal libraries related to this part of the application there was no way for me to get access to them all too fully understand how they all worked. Thus I got to practice my code reading and debugging to figure out how it all worked in order to properly implement changes.

                        My final project given to me about a week before I had to leave was for Shawmut and while I regret not being able to fully finish it, I was able to hand over what I had done leaving the project just under 50% completed. Given how this was yet another completely new system I am fairly happy with how quickly I was able to adapt and set up to develop on the system. I believe that by the time I was working on this project my ability to communicate in a clear and concise manner had improved significantly and I was able to be much more effective when reviewing the changes and asking for clarifications.

                        Overall I am incredibly grateful to have gotten the chance to work at JOMAR as I strongly believe that I was able to further expand my knowledge and skill set through all the different independent developer projects I got to work on and complete. Through the semester I was able to also hone my communication skills to work around the difficulties that were caused by the pandemic while still being able to put out consistent quality work. JOMAR was a unique experience that presented me the opportunity to adapt quickly to shifting project and expectations. Thus going forward I am more confident in my ability to work on large scale systems as a software developer.

                        Starting at SquirrelLife I didn't really have any idea of what to expect. Working with a Masters student and Professor Gilles and Professor Jacobs was going to be an absolutely experience compared to my previous two co-ops. I wasn't going to be working in an office with a supervisor but rather with a student built team dedicated to working on an app and website for the purpose gathering reasearch data. The project that was proposed was to help harness citizen scientists to gather data on and about Squirrels and I was placed on a team of 4 students tasked with developing this new system from the ground up.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>
                        We started by drawing up some preliminary plans on the tools and frameworks that we would be using while the Masters Student, Professor Jacobs and another bio student pulled onto the project would work on determining a the requirements for the application and website. We settled on using a Java Spring backend connected to a PostgreSQL database. The front end would be written in react-native to make it easier for the deployment of the app on both android and apple. The backend would service both the website and the apps via the same API.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>
                        I volunteered to work on the backend as I had more experience with SQL and Java, we decided on using hibernate and ______ alongside the Spring to make it easier for us to interface between the database and the backend logic. The endpoints themselves would be using the HTTP Request methods and jwt's in order to maintain security around user accounts for verification. I had little to no experience in everything except the language and the database design and implmentation so I was eager to learn how to use all these new tools. As time progressed I became the lead on the backend, especially after the other coop working on the backend with me ended their semester.

                        Unlike my other two co-ops there was no "other project" for me to move onto once this was completed, instead we had multiple milestones throughout the co-op that we needed to meet in order to get the app up and running. The first Milestone was to have wireframing and the database design done which we were able to complete with ease. The website work began and implemntation on both the front and back-end could begin in earnest. In retrosepct, looking back on this time, I feel like we were all a bit too eager as we forgot to coordinate everything which lead to a few problems down the line.

                    <p>
                        The website actually went very smoothly, I had been given documents detailing each endpoint and how it needed to be used, and I would implement and connect the databaes and backend logic. When it came to the apps things were a little more chaotic. With no proper documentation until later, it became difficult to coordinate everything we needed. Es[ecially as progress continued to be delayed due to issues with logic and libraries that would occur between android and apple releases on their respective app stores.

                        Eventually we finally managed to have a completed website and the two apps in beta testing by the end of the semester. While there was still more work to be done, I feel confident in looking back and seeing everything that was accomplished.

                        UPDATE: As of writing this I have been working on the project as a volunteer throughout the F21 semester. I couldn't just abandon the project after it was so close to completion. Throughout the semester we went through multiple stages of beta testing and I ended up having to refactor large portions of the backend in order to accomodate all the apps features. One feature that ultimately had to be scrapped until version 2.0 was the GPS tracking as getting permissions and actually recieving the data from the phone was proving to be rather complicated. As of today, a preliminary version of the app is released on the Android store and we are waiting on the Apple store to review it as well. It has been a long semester of meetings and extra work but I am incredibly proud of the final product.
